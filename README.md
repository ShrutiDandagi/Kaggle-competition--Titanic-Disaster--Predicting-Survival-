# Kaggle-competition--Titanic-Disaster--Predicting-Survival-
We are given the train and test data. The training set is used to build our machine learning models. For the training set, we are provided the outcome for each passenger. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class.  The test set is used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we are not provided the ground truth for each passenger. It is our job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model we trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
